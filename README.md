# v1.0
# TaskEasy
I developed this To-Do application after learning Node.js and Express.js Fundamentals to understand how to implement real-time features.

## Note
Currently I am trying to optimize it using MERN stack. So, don't refer to frontend and backend directory for building your project as currently I am working on it.

# For Contributors:
In order to run the project, setup .env and set MONGO_URI variable equal to DB connection string.
In order to avoid port collisions, in the source code port value is 5000

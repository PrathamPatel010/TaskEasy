## Note
I have developed newer version using MERN stack. 

If you want to refer to previous version, it is v1.0
# v1.0
# TaskEasy
I developed this To-Do application after learning Node.js and Express.js Fundamentals to understand how to implement real-time features.

# For Contributors(for v1.0):
In order to run the project, setup .env and set MONGO_URI variable equal to DB connection string.
In order to avoid port collisions, in the source code port value is 5000
